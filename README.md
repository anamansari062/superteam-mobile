# Superteam Mobile

Welcome to the All Things Mobile Project Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for curating resources and showcasing projects related to mobile development within the Solana ecosystem. Whether you're a developer looking to share your latest creation or someone seeking inspiration and guidance, this Readme will guide you through the process of submitting your resource or project.

## Submitting a Resource/Project/SDK

You have two options for submitting a resource/project/sdk: via Pull Request (PR) or by filling out a form.

### Option 1: Submitting via Pull Request (PR)

To submit a resource or project via Pull Request, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository's page to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anamansari062/superteam-mobile.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the directory of the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd superteam-mobile
   ```

4. **Add Your Resource or Project**: Inside the repository, locate the appropriate JSON file (`/Users/anamansari/superteam-mobile/src/routes/learn/data.json` for resources, `/superteam-mobile/src/lib/data.js` for projects, `/superteam-mobile/src/lib/sdk.js` for sdks), and append your resource or project details following the existing format.

5. **Commit and Push Your Changes**: Once you have added your resource or project details, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: added my resource/project"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Compare the changes between your fork and the original repository, then submit the Pull Request.

### Option 2: Submitting via Form

If you prefer not to use Git or GitHub, you can fill out the submission form [here](https://forms.gle/TgAJFXotyCJxeKLn9), fill in the required details, and submit the form. Our team will review your submission and add it to the repository accordingly.

## Review Process

Once you have submitted your resource or project, our team will review it within 3-4 days to ensure it meets our guidelines. We aim to process submissions promptly, but please allow some time for review and processing. Reach out to this [email](mailto:anamansari062@gmail.com), if you don't hear back from us.

Thank you for contributing to the Superteam Mobile! Your submissions play a vital role in enriching our repository and inspiring fellow developers in the Solana ecosystem.
